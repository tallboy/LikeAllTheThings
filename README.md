# LikeAllTheThings
A TamperMonkey script to like all the posts on your Facebook Wall 

## Use with Caution!! ##
This can probably get you banned from some Facebook features until I've experimented with the throttle a bit more

## Installation ##
**It is recommended to use either [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome)** This allows the script to auto-update to the most recent version. The rate of this update can be changed in each extension's preferences.

### [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) ###
